# Swarm-of-micro-flying-robots-in-the-wild
This project develops palm‑sized autonomous drones that can navigate cluttered wild environments like forests using onboard sensors and a spatial‑temporal trajectory planner. It enables safe swarm coordination, obstacle avoidance, and flexible mission execution without relying on external infrastructure
